<mark style="color:blue;">**âžŸ**</mark> Factions may compete for only one ftop prize; creating another faction to win another prize is not allowed. **(Both factions will be disqualified)**\
<mark style="color:blue;">**âžŸ**</mark> No person may play in two different f-top factions (Alting, main account, etc.). Doing so results in an instant DQ for both factions. This only applies if the factions are f-top factions.

<mark style="color:blue;">**âžŸ**</mark> DQ Evading in all its forms (Alting, creating another faction, etc.) is strictly prohibited. **(Disqualification)**

<mark style="color:blue;">**âžŸ**</mark> If your faction is disqualified, you cannot disband it or leave that Faction.\
<mark style="color:blue;">**âžŸ**</mark> As the leader of your faction, it is entirely your responsibility whom you invite into the faction. If you invite someone unknown to your faction and they are sanctioned for something that warrants a strike, you cannot appeal by claiming they were new to your faction.
